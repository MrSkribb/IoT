# Esp-Moisture-Monitor 
An IoT soil monitoring system powered by a moisture sensor and an ESP8266 NodeMCU

The soil's moisture is measured periodically, if the moisture level is too low, an email is sent to you and a blue LED will be lit. If the moisture level is ok, a green LED will be lit and no email will be sent. 

IFTTT handles the email process
